Trillek Core Prototype
======================
This is a prototype of the core engine to be used in the Project Trillek client core and potentially in any GUI based engine tools.  It is a stripped down, openGL version of the my other previous personal project, the Tranquility Engine

Compilation
-----------------
Currently, the build system for this engine is incomplete, as I have limited time to work and would rather spend it adding and polishing features in the engine.  However if you are interested in building it, you will need the following dependencies:  

 * **SDL 2** - os abstraction layer
 * **GLM 0.9.4** - standard math library
 * **ImageMagick++ 6.8** - used to enable broad file support for texture loading
 * **Assimp 3** - used to enable broad file support for asset loading  
 * **GLEW 1.10** - typical OpenGL extension loading support  
 * **TinyXML 2** - used for xml parsing of various config files

I will attempt to get a working CMake configuration file set up in the next few days, but no promises.

File Structure
-------------------
The file structure of the engine is as follows  (subject to change)
 
 * Config - directory for configuration files (other can be elsewhere, but must be specified in the config.xml file)
 * Engine - main source directory
 * Models - default directory for the test models (configurable in config.xml)
 * Shaders - default directory for GLSL shaders (configurable in config.xml)
